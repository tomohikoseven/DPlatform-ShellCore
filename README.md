 +A mystery

## Installation
To begin with DPlatform, run this command:

`wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DFabric/DPlatform-ShellCore/master/init.sh | sudo sh`

or

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DFabric/DPlatform-ShellCore/master/init.sh | sudo sh`

The prerequisites will be installed and the DPlatform git project cloned for you.

Next times, to run DPlatform:
`sudo sh init.sh`

Not recommended because no auto-updates, but you *can* still run directly `dplatform.sh`.

## Requirements
A recent GNU/Linux operating system with **systemd** is recommended, lots of apps have custom systemd services.

Debian 8/9, and derivatives like Ubuntu 16.04 and Raspbian Jessie. Full support, well tested

CentOS 7, Fedora and other RHEL derivatives. Good support, not fully tested

Arch Linux. Partial support, not tested

Older distributions like Ubuntu 14.04.x, Debian 7 and Centos 6 have also a partial support, but you will only be able to install applications and not be able to use systemd services provided by DPlatform.

You can try switch to it instead of the default SysVinit/Upstart to be able to use them.

CPU: x86, x86-64, ARMv[6,7,8]

Development is active. Please feel free to open an issue and create a pull request, all contributions are welcome!

## Roadmap
 - [1] Install apps efficiently through a terminal UI - Done.
 - (2) DPlatform Web GUI to manage apps easily - Early prototypes started
 - (3) Build a custom image with a DPlatform Web GUI and auto-configurations - Planned
 - DNS and secure firewall pass-through via [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me/) - Planned
 - Enhance the security. [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), Nginx reverse proxy, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate - Partial

### Other informations
Each app have its own dedicated user, most their own `/home/app_user` directory
